# Welcome to Pick It Ticket App

Original idea was to make a e com but it is way too much work I changed my mind in the beginning of the project. This project is called Pick It Tickets. This a app where a user is allow to create a tickets, view, update, delete for any events. In V2, I will readd the cart and stripes and put it aside. For now I will be willing to finish the requirement for my project.

## Installation

Step 1: I downloaded my previous template using this link <https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/express-api-auth>.

Step 2: Unzip it and rename it to tickets-api on my terminal.

Step 3: Move into the new project and git init.

Step 4: Empty README.md.

Step 5 I replace express-auth-template in package.json with my projects name.

Step 6: Replace the "homepage" in package.json with my git account and app name.

Step 7: Npm install in terminal.

```
NPM INSTALL
```

Step 8: Git add and git commit changes.

```
GIT ADD .
```

```
GIT COMMIT
```

Step: 9: Check if npm start works.

```
NPM RUN SERVER
```

Step 10: Go to GitHub and create a new repository. I named it just like my template.

Step 11: Pick the second command line that said "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line" and copy that whole line and run it in your terminal.

Step 12: Refresh the page and your whole repository should be up in GitHub and working local.
